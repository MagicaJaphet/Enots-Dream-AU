                        <p>You happen upon a vision, a distant dream. Even from so far you can sense it.</p>

                <p>Should you follow it deeper? It seems dangerous. If you are curious enough, surely you can endure the weight of an endless debacle spiraling through the nature of reality.</p>
                <p>Everything bends, twists out of it's familiar shapes. Only recognizable enough to place vague labels. Are you still curious, peeker? . Fair enough. Perhaps then, you'd care to know more?</p>

                <p>.Wonderful.</p>

            <p>A wanderer. A guest. May I formally welcome you!</p>
            <p>Oh, but of course what is an introduction without a story to tell alongside it?</p>
            <p>You may refer to me as The Dreamer, or any of my several aliases. Who's to say at the end which name was the most important?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Regardless, the story. Yes, the story you came here to perceive.</p>
            <p>I am unsure exactly where it all began to falter, but I can recall where it <i>began</i>.</p>
            <p>I came to awaken in the midst of a terrible storm, unrelenting torture from the torrential rains. They say I must have done something terrible to end up in a place such as this. Others are not even sure if such a place even existed to begin with.</p>
            <p>Some say I was born from it, others say I was born into it.</p>
            <p>The only constant I knew was it. The egg.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The egg I see as a symbol, of life and rebirth. Of an infinite opportunity spiraling into the depths of reality's delicate weaves.</p>
            <p>It granted me power to overcome, but at the dangers of it overtaking myself should I be too careless. As long as I was able to wake again, I could hone this skill.</p>
            <p>I do not know if the egg was a gift, or something irrefutably intertwined with my soul. I found it more to be the latter in those times.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What mattered is that I eventually happened upon an ancient place. Rumors from non-existent beings, devoid of the horror that surface life implied.</p>
            <p>As I neared it, could I say it was in my very nature as well to continue? A sick curiosity? An innate part of me that would have always led me here?</p>
            <p>I stepped into the rusted pond, with fear crossed on my heart. An egg to reassure it.</p>
            <p>If this was just another dead end the egg could always provide a way through. To brute force any problem I had.</p>
            <p>But what came of my adventure into the depths of the Earth would prove much more than the egg could provide.</p>
            <p>Or perhaps, it was the sole thing that provided me the clarity I needed to escape.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As we dissolved, surrogate mother and Scrhodinger's child.</p>
            <p style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px; font-weight: 100;">It grew bright.</p>
            <p style="text-shadow: 0 0 5px; font-weight: 400;">And then grew brighter.</p>
            <p style="text-shadow: 0 0 10px; font-weight: 500;">Brighter than bright.</p>
            <p style="text-shadow: 0 0 20px; font-weight: 600;">Brighter, brighter, brighter, brighter-</p>
            <p>I was going blind.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>.Where was I in this story?</p>
            <p>Oh yes, of course the repercussions of my actions were soon upon me. As if every version of myself had scattered in the perfect reflection.</p>
            <p>An endless hall of mirrors! It was frighting as it was beautiful.</p>
            <p>And I realized, as I moved my hand. In every reflection they moved perfectly. I was. arguably whole.</p>
            <p>Yet still, as my hand moved. I noticed it. The way things subtly shifted. The breeze off of my fingertips would brush a piece of Earth off it's axis.</p>
            <p>And I felt it. Despite the infinite me's, I could process and feel every possibility. It was a gift I rationalized the egg gave to me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My gift. It was important. Suddenly, I as this once insignificant toy to the puppeteers and cruel monsters, I could <i>think</i> and process what had happened. And what will happen.</p>
            <p>I saw it. In the reflections, a slight off-hue that stuck out hideously. Something noticed I too had noticed it. It was the closest I could come to describing direct eye contact with the lack of eyes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was. It was green.</p>
            <p>How oddly familiar.</p>
